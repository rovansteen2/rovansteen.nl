				<p>Solum is a PHP framework build upon components of Symfony and Laravel. It started as a simple CMS for a school assignment for a PHP course, but building a functional programmed application was already a piece of cake for me. So I decided I want to learn more about OOP and design patterns. I started looking at existing frameworks like Symfony and Laravel. I've already been using Laravel but never really understood how it worked far under the hood. So I was like "why not build a framework of my own?". The first draft was one that was build completly from scratch but it was running into some big problems. Then I stumbled upon Symfony components: well tested parts that almost every framework needs but can be implemented in your own framework.</p>
				<p>I also started looking into the design pattern SOLID and started implementing that, to the best of my ability, in the framework. Combined with the Laravel Illuminate Database component and Symfony components the outcome was a framework that uses a nice and simple syntax, inspired by Laravel. You can for example set up new routes by simply using the following syntax:
				<code>Route::get('task.create', 'create', 'TaskController::create');</code>
				Which simply tells Solum to execute the create method in the TaskController class when the user visits the /create page.</p>
